This Scala program calculates the final floor that Santa ends up on based on a set of instructions. The instructions consist of opening and closing parentheses, where '(' represents an upward movement and ')' represents a downward movement. The goal is to determine the floor position Santa reaches after following these instructions.

**HOW TO RUN**

In the terminal, enter this command to run the project:

**sbt run**

When prompted, standard input takes instructions. e.g. "()())" should output 5.

The program will output the final floor that Santa ends up on.
